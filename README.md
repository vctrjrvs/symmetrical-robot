How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
---
The best way to intepret user needs is to put yourself in the perspective of the user themselves, and truly consider the ways in which the user will interact with your product, and the necessary features needed to enhance and streamline user experience. User stories serve to do just that, with each user story effectively following the format of "I, as an end user, would like to perform an action", with the format being malleable to each specific feature needed. This allows you to translate these needs into user stories such as "A user can log in to a home page" or "A user can view a slideshow of travel recommendations".

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
---
I approach developing programs from a very Agile based methodology. The flexibility of Agile and Scrum methodologies make doing the work needed to complete a project much less stressful than a waterfall methodology where my timetables are much more rigid and do not allow for deviations. I always hope to employ kanban boards, regular standups, and open communication with team members in all of my future development work, because those three specifically stand out to me as being incredbily useful in the field of software development.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
---
A good team member is proactive, while always willing to accept whatever comes their way. I think all team members should adopt an honest and open line of communication with other team members and appropriate stakeholders and scrum leaders. They should be able to give and respond well to constrtucive feedback, as well as be forthcoming about any blockers they may be facing during project development, as to not potentially impede the process of the group's work.
